:title: Senior Sailing â€“ Weekly Sailing Races
:slug: learn-to-sail/adults
:body: |
  Do you want to learn to sail?  All ages.

  We sail on Sundays and we hold weekly racing on Tuesday evenings for sailing dinghies with Jollyboats being a popular choice over summer.

  At the senior level we do not run a specific program but often do one on one instruction for new members.  Please contact the office for details.
