  The Maraetai Sailing Club is a community sailing club operating as part of the Maraetai Boat Club. We are a small but active group offering sailing tuition with Optimist, Starling, RS Feva and 29er boats, windsurfing and windfoiling, for junior and senior members alike.

  We offer the opportunity for junior and senior sailors to participate in sailing events both here in Maraetai and at other clubs around Auckland and we regularly host regattas too.
