          p Do you want to learn to sail?  All ages.

          p We sail on Sundays and we hold weekly racing on Tuesday evenings for sailing dinghies with Jollyboats being a popular choice over summer.

          p At the senior level we do not run a specific program but often do one on one instruction for new members.  Please contact the office for details.
